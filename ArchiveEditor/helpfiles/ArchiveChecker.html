<h2>Use</h2>
<p>Use this to check a <strong>.csl</strong> archive you have <em>already</em> created to check its contents for possible errors that may have crept into it.</p>
<h2>To check an archive</h2>
<p><em>Click</em> button: <strong>Check an Archive for possible erroneous entries</strong></p>
<p>A dialogue will open.</p>
<p>Select an <em>existing</em> <strong>.csl</strong> archive file.</p>
<p>The Entries in the archive will be checked against all other entries in the <strong>.csl</strong> file.</p>
<p>A report showing each entry and possible matches in the archive will be produced. Possible matches (where the Callsigns appear to be very similar, or Locators are the same) are displayed.
Note that this may be caused by one of the entries having Postcode information.</p>
<p>Look at the report to see if there are any questionable entries in the archive that need to be checked or edited.</p>
<p><a name="SimilarLocators" /a></p>
<h2>Similar Locators</h2>
<p>Ticking the <strong>Show Similar Locators</strong> box  <em>before</em> checking the archive will additionally display contacts where the Locator is similar rather than an exact match.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Remember people do change QTH and change callsign, particularly from Foundation to Intermediate to Full and good locations are also used by multiple stations, sometimes even at the same time!</p>
<p><strong>Whether a problem exists is entirely up to your judgement.</strong></p>
<p>Date format is: <strong>yyyy/mm/dd</strong></p>
<p><em>Right click</em> on the report for an edit menu which will allow you to cut and paste the report into another document.</p></body></html>
