<h2>Use</h2>
<p>Use this to create a new blank archive or to to add a <strong>.edi</strong> file or files to an <em>existing</em> archive.</p>
<h2>To Create a new archive</h2>
<p><em>Click</em> button: <strong>Create a new .csl archive</strong></p>
<p>Enter the new Archive file name, <em>click</em> <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>blank</em> archive will be created and will be given a <strong>.csl</strong> extension.</p>
<h2>To add a .edi file (or files) to an existing archive</h2>
<p><em>Click</em> button: <strong>Add .edi file (or files) to an existing .csl archive</strong></p>
<p>Select an existing Archive (<strong>.csl</strong> file) from the  Open File dialogue.
In the the next dialogue that opens <em>select</em> a <strong>.edi</strong> file
(or <em>multiselect</em> two or more <strong>.edi</strong> files) produced by <strong>Minos</strong>.
<em>Click</em> <strong>Open</strong>.</p>
<p>The callsigns, Locators and Exchange (if needed) that are being added will be displayed.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>A fouth field is added to the entries in the .csl file which shows the number of times a callsign/locator/exchange combination has been included from <strong>.edi</strong> files.
Times Worked is shown in the <strong>Comments</strong> field in <strong>Minos</strong>.</p>
<p>An extra field is added showing the dates that the contact has been worked, this is not displayed in <strong>Minos</strong>.
Date format is: <strong>yyyy/mm/dd</strong></p>
<p>Quotation marks will be placed around text fields in the <strong>.csl</strong> file.
Some spreadsheets/databases require this.</p>
<p><em>Right click</em> on the report for an edit menu which will allow you to cut and paste the report
into another document. <em>Right click</em> in the report and type <em>Control</em> A to select all the text.</p>
<p>If a contact already exists in the archive on the same same date it will not be added again.
This means that if you select <strong>.edi</strong> files that have already been added to the archive by mistake they will not be added again.</p>
