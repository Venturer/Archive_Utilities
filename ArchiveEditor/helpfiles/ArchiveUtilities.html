<h2>Why use the Archive Utilities?</h2>
<p>The <strong>Minos</strong> contest logger has the facility to load an archive file containing Callsigns, Locators, Exchanges and other information on past contacts.</p>
<p>You can get Minos from: <a href="http://minos.sourceforge.net/history.html">http://minos.sourceforge.net/history.html</a></p>
<p>These files normally have have the extension <strong>.csl</strong> and are based on comma separated variable files.</p>
<p>The <em>Archive Utilities</em> allow you to create and manage these files. The archives can be created and updated from the <strong>.edi</strong> contest entry files produced by <strong>Minos</strong>. The <strong>.edi</strong> files can also be checked against an archive.</p>
<h2>The Archive Utilities Suite comprises:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Archive Maker</strong>. Use this to create a new blank archive or to to add a <strong>.edi</strong> file or files to an <em>existing</em> archive. <a href="ArchiveMaker.html">Click here for Archive Maker help</a></li>
<li><strong>Archive Checker</strong>. Use this to check a <strong>.csl</strong> archive you have <em>already</em> created to check its contents for possible errors that may have crept into it. <a href="ArchiveChecker.html">Click here for help</a></li>
<li><strong>Merge Archives</strong>. Use this to merge two archives you may have created into one archive file. <a href="MergeArchives.html">Click here for help</a></li>
<li><strong>Archive Editor</strong>. Use this to edit an archive. Using this utility helps to preserve the integrity and format of the file. <a href="ArchiveEditor.html">Click here for help</a></li>
<li><strong>Contest Reporter</strong>. Use this to check a <strong>.edi</strong> file against an archive for posible typographic mistakes (such as typing G9BAC instead of G9ABC). <a href="ContestReporter.html">Click here for help</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Each utility has its own detailed help.</p>
<p>Remember people do change QTH and change callsign, particularly from Foundation to Intermediate to Full, and good locations are also used by multiple stations, sometimes even at the same time!</p>
<p><strong>Whether a problem exists is entirely up to your judgement.</strong></p>
<p>Date format is: <strong>yyyy/mm/dd</strong></p>

<h2>Changes from Version 2</h2>

<li>An Archive Editor is now included.</li>
<li>The window positions and sizes are saved when closed and restored when opened again.</li>
<li>Re-written using Python 3 and the Qt 5 framework.</li>
<li>The Python 3 source files are included in the <strong>sources</strong> sub folder of the install folder. They are released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.</li>
