<h2>Use</h2>
<p>This program is intended to suggest where typographic errors in your log <em>may</em> exist (such as typing G9BAC instead of G9ABC).
Remember that there may already be erroneous entries in the archive from earlier mis-typed QSOs.</p>
<h2>To create a report</h2>
<p><em>Click</em> button: <strong>Create Report on Contest Entry</strong></p>
<p>In the dialogue that opens select a <strong>.edi</strong> file produced by <strong>Minos</strong> that you wish to check against an archive.</p>
<p><em>Click</em> <strong>Open</strong>.</p>
<p>Another dialogue will open.
<em>Select</em> an existing <strong>.csl</strong> archive file.</p>
<p><em>Click</em> <strong>Open</strong>.</p>
<p>The entries in the <strong>.edi</strong> file will be checked against those already in the existing <strong>.csl</strong> file.</p>
<p>A report showing each entry in the <strong>.edi</strong> file and possible matches in the archive will be produced.</p>
<p><a name="SimilarLocators" /a></p>
<h2>Similar Locators</h2>
<p>Checking the <strong>Show Similar Locators</strong> box  <em>before</em> checking the archive will additionally display contacts where the Locator is similar rather than an exact match.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><em>Remember people do change QTH and change callsign, particularly from Foundation to Intermediate to Full.and good locations are also used by multiple stations, sometimes even at the same time!</em></p>
<p><strong> <em>Whether a problem exists is entirely up to your judgement.</em> </strong></p>
<p>Date format: <strong>yyyy/mm/dd</strong></p>
<p><em>Right click</em> on the report for an edit menu which will allow you to cut and paste the report into another document.</p></body></html>
