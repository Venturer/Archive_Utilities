*Click* button: **Open .csl archive...**

Enter or select the archive file name, *click* **OK**.

To Edit, Insert or Delete a line, *select* the line and *click* the appropriate button.

To Edit you can also *double click* the line.

The callsigns, Locators and Exchange (if needed) that are being edited will be displayed.

The field showing the dates that the contact has been worked can be Edited, Inserted or Deleted. *Select* the required date in the combo box and *click* the appropriate button.

When saved a field is added automatically to the entries in the **.csl** file which shows the number of times a callsign/locator/exchange combination has been included from **.edi** files.

Times Worked is shown in the **Comment** field in **Minos**.

Quotation marks will be placed around text fields in the **.csl** file. Some spreadsheets/databases require this.
