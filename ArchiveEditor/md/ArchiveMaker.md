# Archive Maker Help
## Use

Use this to create a new blank archive or to to add a **.edi** file or files to an *existing* archive.

## To Create a new archive

*Click* button: **Create a new .csl archive**

Enter the new Archive file name, *click* **Save**.

The *blank* archive will be created and will be given a **.csl** extension.

## To add a .edi file (or files) to an existing archive

*Click* button: **Add .edi file (or files) to an existing .csl archive**

Select an existing Archive (**.csl** file) from the  Open File dialogue.
In the the next dialogue that opens *select* a **.edi** file
(or *multiselect* two or more **.edi** files) produced by **Minos**.
*Click* **Open**.

The callsigns, Locators and Exchange (if needed) that are being added will be displayed.

## Notes

A fouth field is added to the entries in the .csl file which shows the number of times a callsign/locator/exchange combination has been included from **.edi** files.
Times Worked is shown in the **Comments** field in **Minos**.

An extra field is added showing the dates that the contact has been worked, this is not displayed in **Minos**.
Date format is: **yyyy/mm/dd**

Quotation marks will be placed around text fields in the **.csl** file.
Some spreadsheets/databases require this.

*Right click* on the report for an edit menu which will allow you to cut and paste the report
into another document. *Right click* in the report and type *Control* A to select all the text.

If a contact already exists in the archive on the same same date it will not be added again.
This means that if you select **.edi** files that have already been added to the archive by mistake they will not be added again.
