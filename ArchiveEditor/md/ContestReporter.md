# Contest Reporter Help
## Use

This program is intended to suggest where typographic errors in your log *may* exist (such as typing G9BAC instead of G9ABC).
Remember that there may already be erroneous entries in the archive from earlier mis-typed QSOs.

## To create a report

*Click* button: **Create Report on Contest Entry**

In the dialogue that opens select a **.edi** file produced by **Minos** that you wish to check against an archive.

*Click* **Open**.

Another dialogue will open.
*Select* an existing **.csl** archive file.

*Click* **Open**.

The entries in the **.edi** file will be checked against those already in the existing **.csl** file.

A report showing each entry in the **.edi** file and possible matches in the archive will be produced.

## Similar Locators

Checking the **Show Similar Locators** box  *before* checking the archive will additionally display contacts where the Locator is similar rather than an exact match.

## Notes

*Remember people do change QTH and change callsign, particularly from Foundation to Intermediate to Full.and good locations are also used by multiple stations, sometimes even at the same time!*

** *Whether a problem exists is entirely up to your judgement.* **

Date format: **yyyy/mm/dd**

*Right click* on the report for an edit menu which will allow you to cut and paste the report into another document.
